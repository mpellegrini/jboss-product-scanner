JBoss Product Scanner

Overview
--------
The JBoss Product Scanner is a command line utility which attempts to locate JBoss 
product installations on a given machine. The utility will then produce a report listing 
all of the installations found and where they were found on the machine including the product name and 
its version. In addition the utility will attempt to determine if what is installed is 
either unsupported binaries via the JBoss community or supported binaries via the JBoss 
Enterprise subscription.

Note: Certain enterprise platforms, in particular Enterprise Portal Platform, EDS, and BRMS are not currently 
identified correctly and will appear as either Enterprise Application Platform or Enterprise Web Platform.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
Operating Systems: Windows, Mac, Linux
Java Virtual Machine: 1.6.x or later

Usage
-----
The JBoss Product Scanner utility is packaged as a single executable JAR file. To run the
utility type the following:
 
	java -jar jboss-product-scanner-0.9.0.jar [ starting directory path ] 

	If the starting directory path is omitted, it will default to the root "/" directory. 

This will produce a text-based report in the same directory where the program was run from.
The report will be named jboss-prod-scanner-<hostname>.txt
