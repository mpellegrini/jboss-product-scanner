Although a bit more documentation is needed the basic usage of the program is as follows: 

java -jar jboss-scanner-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar [ starting directory path ] 


If the starting directory path is omitted then it will default to the root "/" directory. 


This will produce a text-based report in the same directory where the program is run. 
I have also attached three sample reports to show some of the potential output. In addition to 
what was found and what it could be, I have also added in some additional info like machine 
architecture, available processors on this machine, etc.
